# Cold-start optimization ledger

A scientific ledger for minimizing the time from launching `vv <file>` to seeing the file's content.
Every experiment records a hypothesis, the change, the measured before/after, and whether it was kept.

## Method
- **Profiler:** `VV_PROFILE=1` gates `[vv-profile]` marks in both processes (`vinary.main.profile`,
  `vinary.renderer.profile`), on one wall-clock timeline (`Date.now()` in main; `performance.timeOrigin +
  performance.now()` in the renderer, forwarded to main's stdout via a `console-message` listener). Marks:
  `entry → ready → window` (main) · `eval → init → paint` (renderer) · `did-finish-load → open-sent` (main) ·
  `received → rendered` (renderer). `rendered` = the first content node (`.markdown-body`/`.cm-editor`/
  `.vv-pdf-doc`/…) appears.
- **Harness:** `node scripts/profile-cold-start.mjs [--runs N] [--keep] [fixture …]` launches the GUI exactly
  as the `vv` launcher does (`electron "$REPO" <file>` — NO `--no-sandbox`, which would shift `process.argv`
  and make `doc-uris` open the repo dir instead of the file), N× per fixture under xvfb (forcing X11 so the
  windows stay headless, not on the host Wayland compositor), and reports median ms-from-`entry` per phase.
- Build: `npm run compile` (main + renderer), then run the harness.

## Baseline (before any optimization)
`--runs 3`, headless xvfb, this machine. Median ms from `entry`:

### Phase breakdown (typical) and analysis
| interval | cost | what it is |
|---|---:|---|
| entry → ready | ~115 ms | Electron/Chromium app init (fixed; not our code) |
| ready → window | ~22 ms | `BrowserWindow` create + `loadFile` |
| **window → eval** | **~850 ms** | **renderer process spawn + load/eval of the 11 MB bundle — the dominant cost, ~60%** |
| eval → init | ~0 ms | entry ns → `init` |
| init → paint | ~15 ms | boot to the empty app shell painting |
| paint → did-finish-load | ~235 ms | main-side `did-finish-load` + 7 sequential `init!` round-trips before the file open |
| open-sent → received | ~120 ms | file read + `vv:open`→`vv:content` IPC |
| received → rendered | ~70 ms | the format's render (markdown/pdf/source…) |
| **entry → rendered** | **~1450 ms** | **total cold start to content** |

**Findings.** (1) The bundle load/eval (`window→eval`, ~850 ms) dominates and is **uniform across formats** —
math/org/latex/pdf/source all land at ~1450 ms — because the eager 11 MB bundle loads MathJax (+3 MB fonts),
CodeMirror, and the full markdown/org/latex pipeline regardless of what was opened. This is the single biggest
lever: shrink the boot bundle (code-split) and/or avoid re-paying it per open (warm daemon). (2) A resident
daemon eval's the bundle once at login, so `window→eval` (and a V8 snapshot) become non-issues for warm opens —
confirming the plan's reframing. (3) The 7 pre-open `init!` round-trips add ~235 ms before the file even opens.

## Phase 2 — warm daemon (single-instance + Unix socket)
**Hypothesis.** A resident process (`electron "$REPO" --daemon`) that opens *no* window at start but stays alive
across `window-all-closed` lets each `vv <file>` open a window in the already-warm process instead of a fresh
cold start, so the per-open cost drops even before any window pool (Phase 3).

**Change.** `app.requestSingleInstanceLock()` makes the first process the primary; it also listens on a
systemd-independent Unix socket (`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/vinary-viewer.sock`, `vinary.main.daemon`). The `vv` launcher
is now a thin node client (`scripts/vv-open.mjs`) that sends resolved paths over the socket — and starts
`--daemon` itself if none is reachable (no systemd required; a systemd user unit, if present, merely keeps it
warm at login). Session-global services (`extensions`/`web`/`adblock`/passwords/shell) register once behind a
`services-inited?` guard; `grammars/init!` gained the same guard so a 2nd window can't re-register its handler.

**Measurement.** One resident `--daemon`, then N socket opens of a math `.md`, headless xvfb, this machine,
medians (`tmp/warm-measure.mjs`; `window→rendered` uses the same per-window marks as the cold baseline):

| metric | cold (fresh process) | warm daemon, 1st window | warm daemon, 2nd+ window |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `window → rendered` (per-window cost) | ~1275 ms | ~876 ms | **~697 ms** |
| perceived open (`client → rendered`) | ~1450 ms † | ~935 ms | **~729 ms** |

† the cold figure is `entry→rendered`; the real `vv`-process cold start is *higher* still — it also pays the
Electron-binary load + main-process V8 init that precede the profiler's `entry` mark, all of which the socket
client skips entirely.

**Analysis.** Even with **no window pool yet**, the warm daemon roughly **halves** the open (~1275 → ~697 ms
per-window; ~1450 → ~729 ms perceived). Three effects compound: (1) the main-process/app init (~115 ms
`entry→ready`, plus the un-profiled pre-`entry` binary+V8 bootstrap) is paid once at login, not per open;
(2) the 7 pre-open `init!` round-trips (~235 ms) collapse because the session services are already initialized
(guarded) and their data is cached; (3) Chromium's on-disk **code cache** makes the 2nd+ renderer's 11 MB
bundle *compile* far cheaper than the very first (876 → ~697 ms). The residual ~697 ms is dominated by the
per-window bundle **eval** (each `BrowserWindow` still spawns its own renderer and re-evals the bundle) plus the
file read+render — exactly what **Phase 3's pre-booted window pool** removes (attach the file to an
already-evaluated renderer). **Kept.**

## Phase 3a — warm window pool
**Hypothesis.** The residual ~697 ms of a warm-daemon open is the per-window bundle **eval** — each new
`BrowserWindow` spawns its own renderer and re-evaluates the 11 MB bundle. If the process keeps a small pool of
**pre-booted, hidden, fully-warmed** windows (bundle already evaluated, `init!`s already run), a real open can
just *attach* the file to one and show it, skipping the eval entirely — leaving only the file read + render.

**Change.** `create-window!` was split into `wire-window!` (build + load + per-window `init!`s + session
services, `show?` toggles visible/hidden) and `open-files!` (send `vv:open-files` to an already-loaded
renderer). A pool of hidden windows (`pool`, target `VV_POOL`, default 1; `VV_POOL=0` disables) is pre-booted
after `whenReady` (and refilled after each claim). `claim-window!` pops a warm window, attaches the files,
`show`s it, and refills; if the pool is empty it falls back to a cold `create-window!`. Pool windows live only
in `pool` (never `windows`) so `active-window`/menus never target a hidden one; a claim moves it into `windows`.
The daemon pre-warms the pool at startup and serves every socket open from it.

**Measurement.** One `--daemon` (`VV_POOL=1`), then N socket opens of a math `.md`, headless xvfb, medians
(`tmp/pool-measure.mjs`). `claim→rendered` = a new `claim` mark (pool hit) to the content node appearing:

| metric | cold | warm daemon, no pool | **warm pool (claimed)** |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| open cost to content | ~1275 ms (window→rendered) | ~697 ms (window→rendered) | **~101 ms** (claim→rendered) |
| perceived (`client→rendered`) | ~1450 ms † | ~729 ms | **~127 ms** |

All 4 opens were served from the pool (`claims 4/4`), and the pool refilled each time (5 window boots = 1
initial + 4 refills). The ~101 ms residual is just the file read + `vv:open`→`vv:content` IPC + the format
render — no bundle eval, no `init!` round-trips.

**Analysis.** The pool removes the last big per-open cost: **~1450 → ~127 ms perceived, ~11×** faster, into
near-instant territory. The bundle eval is paid once per pool slot (in the background, off the open's critical
path) instead of once per open. Idle cost is `VV_POOL` hidden renderers (default 1 — a few hundred MB), tunable
down to 0. This is the payoff of the daemon+pool architecture; Phase 1 (code-split + warm-on-idle) will make
each pool boot cheaper and pre-JIT CodeMirror so the first source/math render in a claimed window is instant too.
**Kept.**

## Phase 3b — independent windows (per-window routing)
**Context.** The daemon + pool make it cheap to open *many* windows in one process, so the app is now
genuinely multi-window. The process- and session-level services (`shell`, `web` view, `passwords`,
`extensions`, `adblock`, `ext-popup`) were written for a single window: each captured the *first* window at
`init!` and routed everything to it. With a pool that first window may even be a *hidden* pool window, and with
several windows open, menu actions / the web view / extension popups would target the wrong (or a hidden) one.

**Change.** A new leaf namespace `vinary.main.windows` holds the live-window registry and the shared resolver
`active` (focused window, else most-recently-shown; **never** a hidden pool window — those aren't registered)
and `from-wc` (the window that owns an `event.sender`). `core` registers a window only when it is *shown*
(claimed / cold-created), so the registry excludes the pool. Every service now routes dynamically instead of to
a captured window: `shell/cur-win`, `passwords`, `extensions`, and `adblock` send to `windows/active-wc`; the
shared web view **re-parents** to the window whose renderer requested it (`vv:http-show` → `from-wc`,
preserving the live page) and its relays follow that owner; extension popups anchor to the clicking window
(`from-wc`); each window's Back/Forward keys are wired at most once (tracked as a set, since the view can move).

**Verification.** `tmp/multiwin-test.mjs`: one daemon, two different `.md` files over the socket → two
independent windows each render their own content, `claims 2/2`, pool refilled, and **0** main-process routing
errors. The 316-test suite stays green; `release main` compiles. No latency change (the pool already delivered
~127 ms) — this is correctness: opening files in multiple windows, and using the shared web view / extensions /
passwords, now always act on the window the user is looking at. **Kept.**
